# Coding Challenge with Hive

Hey ðŸ‘‹ We're happy you're here! To give you a taste of life at Hive, we wanted to use an example that's as close to the day-to-day work you'll encounter as possible. This challenge is a (simplified version of) a real feature we've built some time ago at Hive. 

### Expected outcome
Please **clone** this repo, upload your results as a PR in a new private repo, and give us (github users: `lvkleist`, `lukasklinser`) access when you're done.

### User Story

As a shop owner, I want to be able to announce a restocking shipment whenever I need to fill up my inventory in Hive's warehouse.

#### Context
**What's a restocking shipment**: With `Restocking shipment` we concretely mean that a shop owner announces new inventory coming to Hive's warehouse at a specific point in time. You can imagine a shop selling different t-shirts (e.g. white, black and blue) and the white one almost being out of stock. In that case, the shop owner will likely re-order the white t-shirts and announce to us that there will be an inbound delivery.

#### What we value
We don't care whether you're done in 2 hours or take 7 hours to complete the tasks below. Here's a brief overview of what we'd like to see in your submission â†’

* Try to stick to what you'd want to see in "production-level code". This, to us, means solid unit testing (not just the happy case), adapting to our existing coding conventions (example: if you see that we use the blueprinter gem to return JSON data, adopt this convention), and organizing your code in a maintable way (example: using Service Objects when this makes sense for readability and reusability).
* If you have questions, ask â€” you wouldn't just deploy code if you're uncertain in any other setting either, so feel free to reach out if anything is unclear :)

#### What's next
Once you submit a PR on your new repo containing your solution, we'll do a code review to ask questions, give feedback and suggest improvements.

### Tasks
# Main Task
The endpoint restocking_shipment_controller#new should take as input a POST request with a payload of the following form:
`{
    "estimated_arrival_date": "2020-07-01",
    "tracking_code": "YY",
    "shipper": {
        "shipment_provider_id": 1
     },   
    "skus": [
        {"id": 1, "quantity": 2}
    ],
    "shipping_cost": 2
}`

And create the corresponding Restocking Shipment and Restocking Shipment Items. It should then return a JSON object containing the data for the newly created restocking shipment and restocking shipment items. 

Please also add tests in RSpec for the things you implement - we really care about good testing practices, so make sure to invest enough time here!

# Bonus
1. Add authentication in the `authenticate_request!` function, which is currently just a stub

If you have any questions about the scope of the project or details of the business goals, don't hesitate to contact us (leo.vonkleist@hive-logistics.com, lk@hive-logistics.com) with questions while you solve the exercise. Also feel free to use a different database than SQLite if you prefer. Happy coding!
